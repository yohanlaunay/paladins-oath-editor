He is also in full plate purple mithril armor with spiky paldrons, a large diamond-shaped blue gem in the center and a long mask covering his face fully. He is carrying a heavy-looking shield made of pink and purple crystals. The center of the shield has a silver sygil on it, likely the symbol of his clan. His sword is slightly curved, between a scimitar and a long sword, with the same diamond-shape blue gem as his armor."
