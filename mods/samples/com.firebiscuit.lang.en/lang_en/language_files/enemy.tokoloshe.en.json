    "enemy.data.tokoloshe.description.visuals":"Looks like a fairy gone wrong. Elongated puny lims. Head on top of an equally elongated neck. Long pointy ears and a single horn in the center of the forehead. Five or six pairs of wings in decreasing size. the largest being the size of its arms, the smallest barely bigger than a tree leaf. Making one wonder about its usefulness."
