We are creating mods for the game Paladin's Oath which is a digital boardgame from Steam based on the full ruleset from the Mage Knight board game.

- The mods are written using LUA using the full `public/definitions.lua` file for all the symbols and methods available.
- Sample mods are available in `mods/samples/` folder.
- The documentation on how mods work and what resources are available is in `public/docs`.
- The mod we are writing is written in the `mods/com.firebiscuit.automaton/scenario_ext_automaton/automaton.lua` file.
- ignore the root folder and `src/` folder they are used for the game editor and not relevant to this project, only focus on `public/docs` and `mods/` folder.
