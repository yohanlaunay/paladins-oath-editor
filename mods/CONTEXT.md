We are creating mods for the game Paladin's Oath which is a digital boardgame from Steam based on the full ruleset from the Mage Knight board game.

- The mods are written using LUA using the full `definitions.lua` file for all the symbols and methods available.
- Sample mods are available in samples/ folder.
- The documentation on how mods work and what resources are available is in docs/README.
- The mod we are writing is written in the `automaton.lua` file.
