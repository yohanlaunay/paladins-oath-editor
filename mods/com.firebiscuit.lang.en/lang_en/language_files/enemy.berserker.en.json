One arm ending with claws, the other with a large bone-like spike. Human skeleton heads hanging around its belt. Its head looks like a thin human skeletal head ecept its jaw is un-naturally elongated and deformed. It has some glowing rune on its forehead, likely a sign of it being summoned from another world. Its back is covered with bone spikes."
