    "enemy.data.night_gaunt.description.visuals":"Red bipedal humanoid creature with elongated limbs. Arms longer than its body and could touch the ground. Makes one wonder if it could use its arms to walk, like primates would. Its head looks like a conch shell with a single hole in the middle, no discernable facial features. Its back is covered in white corals and red tentacles."
