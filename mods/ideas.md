# Scenario Extension Ideas

Here are 10 ideas for interesting scenario extensions, leveraging the Paladin's Oath modding capabilities:

1.  **Vampiric Thirst:** At the start of each turn, the player gains a "Wound" card. However, for each enemy defeated in the previous turn, the player can heal one wound from their hand or discard pile at the end of the turn. This encourages aggressive play to manage the constant damage.

2.  **Dynamic Bounties:** At the start of each round, a random revealed enemy on the map is marked as a "Bounty." Defeating this specific enemy before the round ends grants the player bonus XP and Reputation. This would create shifting priorities each round.

3.  **The Wandering Merchant:** A special merchant appears at a random village at the start of the game. At the end of each round, the merchant moves to an adjacent village. The merchant could offer rare cards, followers, or blessings not found in the standard markets.

4.  **Seasonal Cycles:** The game cycles through "Summer" and "Winter" each round. During Summer, movement is easier (e.g., plains and forests cost 1 less movement point). During Winter, movement is harder (e.g., all terrain costs 1 extra movement point), and ending your turn outside of a fortified location or village gives you a Wound card from the cold.

5.  **Mana Overload:** At the end of a player's turn, for every two unspent mana crystals in their inventory, they receive a "Wound" card, representing magical feedback. This forces players to use their resources efficiently and prevents hoarding.

6.  **Living Dungeons:** Any dungeon that is not conquered by the end of the round gets stronger. A random, unrevealed enemy inside it is revealed and adds to its defenders for the next round. This creates a "ticking clock" and a sense of urgency.

7.  **Oath Quests:** When the scenario starts, the player receives a specific side quest based on their chosen Oath. For example, an "Oath of Conquest" player might be tasked with defeating 3 rampaging enemies, while an "Oath of Devotion" player might need to visit all Temples on the map. Completing the quest would grant a unique, powerful reward.

8.  **Unstable Magic:** Every time a player casts a Spell, there is a small chance of a "wild magic" surge. This could have a random positive or negative effect, such as drawing an extra card, spawning a weak monster on a nearby tile, or gaining a random mana token.

9.  **Follower Uprisings:** If a player has a follower with maximum wounds at the end of a round, the follower "deserts" and is returned to the market. This makes protecting your followers more critical.

10. **Corrupted Lands:** A specific terrain type (e.g., Wasteland) becomes "Corrupted." Ending your turn on a Corrupted hex gives the player a Wound card. At the end of each round, the corruption spreads to one adjacent, non-city hex, slowly consuming the map.
