# Scenario Extension Ideas

Here are 10 new ideas for scenario extensions, leveraging the Paladin's Oath modding capabilities:

1.  **Chrono-Shift Anomaly:** At the end of a player's turn, there's a small chance that the time of day is immediately shifted from Day to Night or vice-versa, potentially disrupting player plans or creating new opportunities.
2.  **Resource Hoarder:** A unique enemy spawns at the start of the game. If it reaches a specific location type (e.g., a village), it "loots" it, removing all items from the market for that location and gaining buffs. The player must stop it.
3.  **Heroic Sacrifice:** If a player has no followers and is about to take a wound, they can discard a specific type of card (e.g., a spell) to prevent the wound, but incur a temporary debuff instead.
4.  **Mimicry Trap:** Certain terrain types (e.g., plains) have a very small chance to reveal themselves as an enemy when the player attempts to move onto them, creating an ambush.
5.  **Mana Resonance:** If the player accumulates a certain amount of mana crystals of the same color at the end of their turn, they gain a temporary bonus related to that color (e.g., Red: +1 Attack; Blue: +1 Block).
6.  **"Familiar Spirit" Companion:** A new unique follower that cannot be destroyed normally. Instead, if it takes lethal damage, it becomes "dormant" for a few rounds (tracked in `ModState`) before reappearing.
7.  **Prophecy Fulfilled:** At the start of the crusade, a hidden objective (e.g., "Defeat an Abomination with a Fire attack") is set. Fulfilling it later in the game grants a powerful, unique blessing.
8.  **Enemy Teleporters:** A specific, elusive enemy type has a chance to teleport to a random empty hex anywhere on the map after taking damage, making it hard to pin down.
9.  **Overgrown Paths:** Forest hexes have an increased movement cost when moving *through* them, but a reduced movement cost when ending a turn *on* them (representing resting in cover).
10. **The Grand Bazaar:** A specific market location periodically offers a unique, powerful item at a very high price. This item is limited and disappears after a few rounds.
