|'''Frost / Ice'''
Frost Attacks can be blocked by '''Fire''' or '''Chaos''' Blocks. Any other Block Element is considered '''inefficient''', meaning you need to double the amount of Block points needed.

Attacking Enemies with Frost Resistance using a Frost Attack will make the Attack '''inefficient''', meaning you need to double the amount of Attack points needed.

Enemies with Frost Resistance are '''not affected''' by any card effect triggered using '''Blue''' Mana (or Blue Cards).

When a Follower with '''Frost Resistance''' is used to '''tank''' Frost Attacks from Enemies, we first deduct the Attack value from the Armor before applying the first '''Wound'''.
