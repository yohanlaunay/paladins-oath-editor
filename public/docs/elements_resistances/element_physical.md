|'''Physical''' (Default Value)
Physical Element (or absence of Element) is the default.

Physical Attacks can be blocked by any kind of Elemental Block ''including Physical''.

Attacking Enemies with Physical Resistance using a Physical Attack will make the Attack '''inefficient''', meaning you need to double the amount of Attack points needed.

When a Follower with '''Physical Resistance''' is used to '''tank''' Physical Attacks from Enemies, we first deduct the Attack value from the Armor before applying the first '''Wound'''.
