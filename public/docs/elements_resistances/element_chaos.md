|'''Chaos'''
Chaos Attacks can '''only''' be blocked by '''Chaos''' Blocks. Any other Block Element is considered '''inefficient''', meaning you need to double the amount of Block points needed.

Attacking Enemies with Chaos Resistance using a Chaos Attack will make the Attack '''inefficient''', meaning you need to double the amount of Attack points needed.

Enemies with Chaos Resistance are n'''ot affected''' by any card effect triggered using '''Blue''' or '''Red''' Mana (or Blue/Red Cards).

When a Follower with '''Chaos Resistance''' is used to '''tank''' Chaos Attacks from Enemies, we first deduct the Attack value from the Armor before applying the first '''Wound'''.
