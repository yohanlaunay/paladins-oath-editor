|'''Fire'''
Fire Attacks can be blocked by '''Frost''' or '''Chaos''' Blocks. Any other Block Element is considered '''inefficient''', meaning you need to double the amount of Block points needed.

Attacking Enemies with Fire Resistance using a Fire Attack will make the Attack '''inefficient''', meaning you need to double the amount of Attack points needed.

Enemies with Fire Resistance are '''not affected''' by any card effect triggered using '''Red''' Mana (or Red Cards).

When a Follower with '''Fire Resistance''' is used to '''tank''' Fire Attacks from Enemies, we first deduct the Attack value from the Armor before applying the first '''Wound'''.
