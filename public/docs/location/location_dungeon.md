Enter to battle with the enemies lurking there and loot their '''Relics''' or'''Spells''' stash. Your followers will '''not participate''' and '''Night''' restrictions apply (Black mana can be used).

Rewards (random): 1 Relic (draw 2 pick 1) OR 1 Spell

Can be re-entered to trigger another battle but there won't be any more loot to be found.
