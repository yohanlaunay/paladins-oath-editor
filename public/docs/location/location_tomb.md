Enter to battle with the enemies lurking there and loot their '''Relics''' and '''Spells''' stash. Your followers will '''not participate''' and '''Night''' restrictions apply (Black mana can be used).

Rewards: 1 Relic (draw 2 pick 1) + 1 Spell

Can be re-entered to trigger another battle but there won't be any more loot to be found.
