List of '''Fortification Types''' for Paladin's Oath Digital Card Game:

The level of Fortification that Enemies have dictates what kind of '''Attack''' can target them during the ''Range Attack'' phase of Battle. Their Fortification level has no impact in the ''Attack'' phase of Battle where any kind of Attack can be used.

===Locations Fortifications===
Some locations also provide additional Fortification which increases the base Fortification level of the enemy:

*'''Not Fortified''' Enemies in a '''Fortified''' Location gives the Enemy '''Fortified''' status, meaning only '''Siege''' Attacks can target them.
*'''Fortified''' Enemies in a '''Fortified''' Location gives the Enemy '''Double Fortified''' status, meaning they cannot be targeted by any type of Attack.
*'''Double Fortified''' Enemies are already at the max level and ''will not benefit'' from the Location's Fortification unless the Enemy's fortification is reduced by some card effect.
*'''Never Fortified''' Enemies will never be affected by any kind of Fortification buff/debuff.

===Ignoring Site Fortifications===
Some Card effects target the Location Fortification and will force the Enemies to revert back to their innate Fortification level.

===Grouped Enemies during Battle===
If you group enemies with a mix level of Fortification, all the grouped enemies will benefit from the highest level of Fortification in the group and will only be targetable by the appropriate type of range Attack. Except for '''Never Fortified''' enemies which will never benefit from any kind of Fortification.
