''The High Priestess is a powerful figure in the Arcane Order. She goes from Temple to Temple inspecting reliquaries and ensuring the powerful relics they contain are in order. Usually reluctant to engage in worldly affairs, the recent occurrences of corrupted Magic since the conjunction of the planes has made her wary and willing to help.''
