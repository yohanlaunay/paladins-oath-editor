Although Paladin's Oath is its own game, some concepts are based on Mage Knight. For players coming from the Mage Knight world it might be helpful to understand the main differences between Paladin's Oath and Mage Knight.

* '''Oath'''
**This concept doesn't exist in MK. It allows your character to get some initial blessings or followers, as well as get some bonuses every round. You can also play without such bonuses, then you just keep the default "Oath of Piety".
* '''Dummy player vs Timer'''
**In MK you don't know which cards the dummy player will draw even though the deck is already set. PO knows this too but to simplify the user experience, it turns this information + crystals in the timer's inventory into a number of turns. It's the same except it's speeded up the process and made it transparent. (otherwise it would be necessary to explain what the timer does, show some cards being drawn, show the crystals, etc.).
* '''Terminology differences and similarities'''
**Here are some important words that have a very similar meaning between PO and MK:
***Ambient Mana <-> Mana Source
