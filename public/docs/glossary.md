|- 
|'''Abilities (Market)'''
|These are the abilities available to learn. They are typically acquired when '''Leveling-up''' or purchased at certain ''Locations''.
|-
|'''Ambient Mana'''
|Exists in the environment and can be used in a limited capacity. Any used Ambient Mana will be ''re-rolled'' at the end of the turn.
|-
|'''Ambient Mana (Restriction)'''
|Ambient Mana can only be used a limited number of times per turn (default ''1''). You can use Abilities to gain access to more Ambient Mana on that turn.
|-
|'''Arcane Immunity'''
|Enemies with '''Arcane Immunity''' are immune to any kind of non-attack and non-block effects (example: effects reducing fortifications or cancelling their attacks).
|-
|'''Armor'''
|Entity Armor is used to reduce the number of ''Wounds'' taken. If any ''Damage'' is done, the entity receives '''1''' Wound, then the damage is reduced by the entity's Armor. Take more wounds, reduce by armor, etc, until the damage to be dealt is reduced to 0. If the entity has ''Resistance'' to the damage ''Element'' type, then before taking the first Wound, the damage is first reduced by the entity's Armor.
|-
|'''Attack Modifiers'''
|Certain attacks can have modifiers (Poison, Paralysis, etc.). They affect how the Attack behaves and/or how it should be handled by the Player. Look for the Icons on the Enemy's Attacks and plan accordingly.
|-
|'''Benediction Initiative'''
|Every round you get to pick a '''Benediction'''. Each Benediction has an ''initiative order'' that determines whether you will take a turn before or after the timer / dummy player.
|-
|'''Benedictions'''
|Every round you get to pick a '''Benediction''' providing unique Abilities or perks for the round. Day and Night offer different choices. Each Benediction has an Initiative Order which determines whether you will take a turn before or after the Timer / dummy player.
|-
|'''Black Mana'''
|''Special'' mana color. Can only be used at '''Night''' and is inert during Day time.
|-
|'''Blessings'''
|When you level-up you main gain a Blessing from your Deity. These are very powerful Abilities usable once a Round or Turn (see icon on the card for details).
|-
|'''Blocking'''
|Blocks are used during Battle in the ''Block'' phase. Use cards, followers and Blessings to generate Blocks then drag them on the Attack that you want to Block. Blocks are '''All or Nothing''' so you need an amount of Block equal or greater than the Enemy's Attack Value ('''x2''' if the enemy is Resistant to the Block type). Blocked attacks do not generate Damage / Wounds.
|-
|'''Bulky Attack'''
|Enemy with '''Bulky''' attacks are very heavy and slow. '''Movement''' can be used to ''reduce'' the attack strength.
|-
|'''Cancelling Attacks'''
|Cancelled attacks do not occur and thus do not need to be Blocked and will not generate Wounds or additional effects.
|-
|'''Effects'''
|Generated by Cards, Blessings, Followers or Locations. Some effects require you to drag & drop from the pool to the relevant target (Enemy, Card, ...) to activate them while others are applied passively.
|-
|'''Elemental Attack'''
|Fire / Frost / Chaos attacks can be used against enemies with resistance to opposite type of attacks (Fire > Physical & Frost; Frost > Physical & Fire; Chaos > anything).
|-
|'''Elemental Blocks'''
|Some enemies have resistance to Physical or Elemental attacks and Blocks. Using Elemental Blocks against enemies with resistance to that element makes the block '''inefficient''' (ex: Fire Block against Fire attack) and will require double the amount of Block points to be successful.
|-
|'''Elusive Enemy'''
|Some enemies are hard to grasp unless you '''Block''' them first. These elusive Enemies have different '''Armor''' values based on whether they have been blocked (lower armor value) or unblocked (higher armor value).
|-
|'''Experience Points (XP)'''
|XP is earned by defeating enemies or playing certain abilities. Allows you to level-up which unlocks new skills and abilities.
|-
|'''Exploration Cost'''
|To expand the map you go to the edges and pay Movement points to explore a new section. The number of sections for the crusade is limited and the map will '''follow''' where you explore until you run out of sections.
|-
|'''Exploration Distance'''
|To explore you normally need to be adjacent to the edges of the map (exploration distance of '''1'''). Some abilities allow you to explore by being further away from the edges of the map.
|-
|'''Follower Blessing'''
|Powerful Relics can be activated to Bless a follower, thus granting them special abilities or increased stats. Blessings attached to a Follower can be detached at the Campfire but the Associated relic will be put back in the Discard pile to be drawn on the next round.
|-
|'''Follower Level'''
|The level of your follower determines the cost to Heal them when they are wounded. Some abilities also target followers of certain levels.
|-
|'''Followers'''
|Followers are always-on cards that can be recruited at certain Locations by spending Leadership points. Open the ''Market'' to check what Followers are available and where to find them. Once acquired, one of their abilities can be activated once per round. Followers become exhausted once activated and will be refreshed at the beginning of the next round or by using special abilities.
|-
|'''Fortifications'''
|Some enemies have natural Fortifications. Others gain Fortifications when they occupy a Fortified Location that you are assaulting. Fortifications prevent usage of non-siege Attacks during the Range phase of combat. Fortifications can stack so already fortified enemies in a fortified location will become double-fortified and you won't be able to use Siege attacks when targeting them. If you group fortified enemies with non-fortified enemies during battle, all the grouped enemies will benefit from the fortifications.
|-
|'''Gold Mana'''

|-
|'''Movement'''
|Movement points allow your character to move around the map and explore. The cost depends on the type of terrain.

|-
|'''Range Attack'''
|Range attacks can be used in ''any'' attack phase. In the Range phase of combat, they can only be used to target enemies that are not fortified.
|-
|'''Refreshing a Follower'''
|When a Follower has been activated they become exhausted (are resting). They are automatically refreshed at the beginning of the next round or if you use special abilities to refresh them.

|-
|'''Resistances'''
|Some enemies or Followers have Resistances to certain type of Elements or Physical Resistances. Resistance on Enemies make Attacks or Blocks of the same type inneficient, requiring double the amount. On Followers, resitances are applied before taking damage of the resistant type by first reducing the damage taken by the armor value of the Follower, then applying damage as per normal (if any left).

|-
|'''Summoned Enemy'''
|Some Magical Enemies (typically Arcanum types) have the ability to summon other Enemies to come to their aid in Battle instead of performing direct attacks themselves. When a summoning attack occurs, the summoner will spawn a new enemy. This is the summoned enemy's attack that you will need to block to consider the Summoner as successfully blocked.
|-
|'''Teleport'''
|Teleport points supersede movement points and allow your character to move around the map one hex/space at a time (1 teleport point = 1 space). Teleporting does not trigger enemies on the map and allows you to teleport to unreachable places too (ex: Mountains or Lakes). Careful not to get stuck!
|-
|'''Terrain Movement Cost'''
|Depending on Terrain, you will need to pay a variable amount of Movement points to pass through it. Some terrains are impassable (ex: Mountains or lakes) without special abilities (or teleport).
|-
|'''Turns'''
|Each Day/Night round has a certain number of turns. Each turn ends automatically when you interact with a Location or Battle with Enemies. Mana essence is discarded and you will draw cards back to hand size. The number of turns depends on how many cards you are using. Once you have an empty deck of cards you can choose to move to the next round. Once both your hand and deck are empty you must move to the next round. If you are using a timer, the timer will provide limit the number of turns available each round to prevent the game from taking too long.
|-
|'''Wound'''
|Cards that clog your hand. They can only be discarded at the end of the Day/Night; via special effects or by resting/recovering at the end of the turn. You can also use Healing points or location effects to remove them completely.
