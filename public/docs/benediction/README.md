Benedictions are given at the beginning of each round and allows the Paladin to start the round with bonuses or other boons for the whole round ex: ability to re-roll Ambient Mana, draw more cards each turn or mulligan their hand.

Each Benediction also has an '''Initiative Value''' in the top left corner indicating the order the Paladin will take their turn vs the Dummy Timer. This only matters towards the End of the Round as that might give the Paladin one more turn.

In some Scenarios, the benedictions are removed from the game after being picked by the Paladin and sometimes also when picked by the Dummy.
